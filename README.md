# ComputerGraphics


To use the MATLAB scripts, save them both in your workspace and enter a command like:  
```MATLAB
A = shiftAndScale(readPoints('/Users/Username/Desktop/imagename.jpg',5))  
```
where ```5``` is the number of points you want to estimate a curve with.  
  
Then go to Terminal, go to your MATLAB folder (usually in /Documents) and ```nano pointspoints.txt```   
You should see some c++ which can be easily placed in main.cpp. Just update the ```vector<vector>``` toTour to include the ```newPoints__``` vector.
